# KTX: math utilities

Math extensions and operator overloads for LibGDX math API.

### Why?

Java does not feature operator overloading, which leads to weird constructs like `vector.add(a).sub(b)`. Kotlin brings
the possibility to use a much more readable and natural syntax with its operators overloading: `vector + a - b`. However,
LibGDX API does not match Kotlin naming conventions (necessary for operators to work), which means extension functions
are necessary to make it work like that.

### Guide

#### `Vector2`

- `vec2` is a global factory function that can create `Vector2` instances with named parameters for extra readability.
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=` can be used to add, subtract, multiply or divide current values according to the second
vector. Use these operators to _mutate_ existing vectors.
- `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` can be used to add, subtract, multiply or divide vectors according to the second vector, resulting
in a new vector. Use these operators to _create_ new instances of vectors.
- Unary `-` operator (a single minus before the vector) allows to negate both vector values.
- `*` and `/` can be used with floats and ints to multiply or divide both vector values.
- `++` and `--` operators can be used to increment and decrement both x and y values of the vector. Note that since
`Vector2` class is mutable, both these operations modify the internal state of the vector. This means that both `++vector`
and `vector++` are effectively the same, as previous state of the vector is not kept (to limit the amount of constructed
objects).
- `Vector2` instances can be destructed to two float variables in one step with `val (x, y) = vector2` syntax thanks to
`component1()` and `component2()` operator methods.
- `Vector2` instances are now comparable - `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` operators can be used to determine which vector has greater
(or equal) overall length. While this certainly does not fit all use cases, we consider it the most commonly compared
value. It can be used to determine which vector is further from a certain common point (for example, which *Box2D* `Body`
is further from the center of the `World` or which touch event is further from the `Viewport` center). It can be also
used to quickly determine which velocity or force is greater. Note that length *squared* is actually compared, as it is
much faster to calculate and yields the same results in most cases.
- `dot` infix function allows to calculate the dot product of 2 vectors.
- `x` infix function allows to calculate the cross product of 2 vectors.

Note that since `Shape2D` has `contains(Vector2)` method, `in` operator can be used for any `Shape2D` implementation
(like `Rectangle`, `Ellipse` or `Circle`). For example, given `vec: Vector2` and `rect: Rectangle` variables, you can
call `vec in rect` (or `vec !in rect`) to check if the rectangle contains (or doesn't) the point stored by the vector.

#### `ImmutableVector2`
- `ImmutableVector2` is an immutable equivalent to `Vector2`. It provides most of the functionaries of `Vector2`, but
mutation methods return a new vector instead of mutate the reference.
- Note that one may want to create type aliases to makes the usage more concise: `typealias Vect2 = ImmutableVector2`
- `ImmutableVector` is comparable (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` are available). Comparison is evaluated by length
- instances can be destructed: `val (x, y) = vector2`
- `Vector2.toImmutableVector2()` Returns an immutable vector with same `x` and `y` attributes than this `Vector2`
- `ImmutableVector2.toVector2()` Returns an mutable vector with same `x` and `y` attributes than this `ImmutableVector2`
- Notable difference with `Vector2`
  - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` are available and replace `add`, `sub` and `scl`
  - `withLength()` and `withLength2()` replace `setLength()` and `setLength2()` and return a new vector of same direction
  with the specified length
  - `withRandomRotation` replace `setToRandomRotation` and return a new vector of same length and a random rotation
  - `withAngleDeg()` and `withAngleRad` replace `setAngle` and `setAngleRad` and return a new vector of same length and
  the given angle to x-axis
  - `cpy` is not provided and is not necessary. Immutable vectors can be safely shared.
  - `set(x, y)` and `setZero()` are not provided.   
  - Functions dealing with angles in degree are suffixed with `Deg` and all returns values between `-180` and `+180`.
  - All angle functions return the angle toward positive y-axis.
  - `dot` is an infix function
  - `x` and `crs` infix functions replace `crs` (cross product)

#### `Vector3`

- `vec3` is a global factory function that can create `Vector3` instances with named parameters for extra readability.
It is also overloaded with a second variant that allows to convert `Vector2` instances to `Vector3`.
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=` can be used to add, subtract, multiply or divide current values according to the second
vector. Use these operators to _mutate_ existing vectors.
- `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` can be used to add, subtract, multiply or divide vectors according to the second
vector, resulting in a new vector. Use these operators to _create_ new instances of vectors.
- Unary `-` operator (a single minus before the vector) allows to negate all vector values.
- `*` and `/` can be used with floats and ints to multiply or divide all vector values.
- `++` and `--` operators can be used to increment and decrement x, y and z values of the vector. Note that since
`Vector3` class is mutable, both these operations modify the internal state of the vector. This means that both `++vector`
and `vector++` are effectively the same, as previous state of the vector is not kept (to limit the amount of constructed
objects).
- `Vector3` instances can be destructed to tree float variables in one step with `val (x, y, z) = vector3` syntax thanks
to `component1()`, `component2()` and `component3` operator methods.
- `Vector3` instances are now comparable - `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` operators can be used to determine which vector has greater
(or equal) overall length, similarly to how `Vector2` now works.
- `dot` infix function allows to calculate the dot product of 2 vectors.
- `x` infix function allows to calculate the cross product of 2 vectors.

#### `Matrix3`

- `mat3` is a human-readable global factory function that allows to easily create `Matrix3` instances.
- Unary `-` operator (a single minus before the matrix) can be used to negate all matrix values.
- `!` operator before the matrix inverts it, calling `inv()`.
- `+=` and `-=` can be used to add and subtract values from second matrix. Use these operators to _mutate_
existing matrix instances.
- `+` and `-` can be used to add and subtract values from other matrices. Use these operators to _create_
new instances of matrices.
- `*` operator can be used to right-multiply the matrix with another matrix using `mul(Matrix3)` method.
- `*` operator can be used to scale the X and Y components of the matrix with a float of a vector using `scl` methods.
- `Matrix3` instances can be multiplied with a `Vector2` using `*` operator.
- `Matrix3` instances can be destructed into nine float variables (each representing one of its cells) thanks to the
`component1()` - `component9()` operator functions.

#### `Matrix4`

- `mat4` is a human-readable global factory function that allows to easily create `Matrix4` instances.
- Unary `-` operator (a single minus before the matrix) can be used to negate all matrix values.
- `!` operator before the matrix inverts it, calling `inv()`.
- `+=` and `-=` can be used to add and subtract values from second matrix. Use these operators to _mutate_
existing matrix instances.
- `+` and `-` can be used to add and subtract values from other matrices. Use these operators to _create_
new instances of matrices.
- `*` operator can be used to right-multiply the matrix with another matrix using `mul(Matrix4)` method.
- `*` operator can be used to scale the X and Y components of the matrix with a float of a vector using `scl` methods.
- `Matrix4` instances can be multiplied with a `Vector3` using `*` operator.
- `Matrix4` instances can be destructed into sixteen float variables (each representing one of its cells) thanks to the
`component1()` - `component16()` operator functions.

### Alternatives

- [Kotlin Statistics](https://github.com/thomasnield/kotlin-statistics) contains idiomatic Kotlin wrappers over
[Apache Commons Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/stat.html). Its extension functions might
prove useful during game development.
- [Jvm Glm](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/glm) is the kotlin port of the famous [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) lib by g-truc.

Sadly, it does not seem that there are any public math-related Kotlin libraries that would make LibGDX math API usage more
natural. You can try browsing through existing general purpose LibGDX extensions - some of them contain static methods
for various math operations missing in the official API.
