/**
 * LinkedList equivalent for LibGDX applications that caches its nodes and iterator to generate as little garbage as
 * possible. As opposed to LibGDX PooledLinkedList, this list implements [Iterable] and has more Kotlin-friendly syntax
 * for extra utility. This class does not offer operations that usually should not be performed on linked lists - like
 * removal by element - but it contains some extra methods that can be used during iteration like [insertAfter], [remove]
 * or [insertBefore].
 *
 * Unfortunately, since there is no common interface for LibGDX collections (and java.util interfaces are avoided for
 * a good reason), this list shares no interface with the other collections. However, this class comes with its own
 * utility methods.
 *
 * This collection is excellent for queues or storage of objects that often have to be removed during iteration for
 * little cost. By design, it provides no random access to elements - it should be used when iteration is very often.
 *
 * @param nodePool provides and manages [Node] instances.
